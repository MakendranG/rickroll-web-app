# Rickroll Web App

This is a simple Flask web application that rickrolls users by redirecting them to Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" on YouTube.

## How It Works

- The application listens for requests to the root URL (`/`).
- Upon visiting the URL, users are redirected to the infamous Rickroll video.
